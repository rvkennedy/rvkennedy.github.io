<div class="textblock"><pre class="fragment">Version 3.1.0
The Camera library has been merged into the Platform/CrossPlatform library. camera:: should now be crossplatform::
DirectX 9 support has been removed.
Camera has a speed factor (see the properties panel).
CrossPlatform shaders are now in Simul/Platform/CrossPlatform/SL.
In Simul/Platform/CrossPlatform are the new crossplatform base classes for rendering. Of particular interest is DeviceContext.

Version 3.0.7
TextInputOutput has been moved to CrossPlatform to avoid two-way library dependencies now that it is used in Terrain library.

Version 2.9.2.3
Switched from GLUT to Freeglut for OpenGL.

RenderSky() has been removed from BaseWeatherRenderer.

Version 2.9.0.0
Added Unicode filename support to TextInputOutput.
Most dx11 render classes are now in the simul::dx11 namespace.
GetAllModifiableKeyframes() added to BaseKeyframer.

Version 2.8.0.5
To avoid confusion, the following have been removed from BaseSkyRenderer: GetLightColour, GetAmbientColour, GetDirectionToLight, GetDirectionToSun.
Use the equivalent functions in SkyKeyframer instead.

simul::math::Matrix4x4 has been given a union to correspond better with D3DXMATRIX, so now you can access Matrix4x4 using M._13, or M[1][3], as well as using M(1,3) etc.

The recommended WeatherRenderer function to draw the sky is now RenderSkyAsOverlay, which takes an optional depth texture as an input.
Now each frame, the WeatherRenderer's PreRender() function should be called. This is to perform once-per-frame updates that need not be repeated when the sky is rendered multiple times within a frame.

Version 2.8.0.3
Removed numerous pass-through functions in the BaseCloudRenderer - better to call these or the equivalent direct from CloudKeyframer.
In view of DX11, and for other API's, context is now passed as a void* pointer to rendering classes, rather than storing the immediate context in the class from initialization.

Version 2.8.0.0
Removed Loss and inscatter calculations from CloudGeometryHelper - better to use textures for this.

Version 2.7.0.3
gamma.fx changed to simul_hdr.fx.
Removed GpuCloudGenerator from DX9 implementation - if needed, please use the GL cloud generator for DX9 rendering.

Version 2.6.0.15
There is now a functioning text file format, the .sq file, and this is the main format for Sky Sequencer. In the future,
the binary format will change from version to version, so sequences should be stored as text .sq files, and the binary .seq format should be used only for final export.Sun and Moon texture filenames are stored in the sky keyframer as text values.Version 2.6.0.14

Version 2.6.0.3
Depth texture (actually an image texture with depth in the alpha) is passed to the clouds if needed in Render().
Clouds mixing with terrain etc is implemented in OpenGL. This is a two-pass process. Clouds are rendered initially as background, then a later pass fills in any clouds needed to go in front of depth objets like mountains.Version 2.6.0.2

Removed DX1x directory and moved the code into Simul/Platform/DirectX11: DX10 is no longer supported.
FadeMode is removed - fragment fade is always faster than vertex.
RTTI is disabled by default.Version 2.6.0.1

Sequencer: Del, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V keys enabled, with delete, copy and past functions. Text entry for various sliders enabled. Undo improved.
DX11: Reverse depth buffer optionVersion 2.6.0.0

Version 2.5.0.15
UseMoon is removed from sky keyframes - because switching to moon lighting can be handled automatically.Fixed VC9-VC10 file format error caused by sizeof(std::streamoff).Version 2.5.0.14

Fixed .dll problem in sequencer.
Fixed new() sequence command.Version 2.5.0.13

Version 2.5.0.0000
In CloudGeometryHelper DetailPersistence defaults to the new lower value of 0.85.
RestoreDeviceObjects and InvalidateDeviceObjects now return void, instead of bool - the result was not useful.
Also, these functions are now pure virtual in BaseWeatherRenderer.Version 3.0.0.0000

Cloud and sky keyframers are now mostly kept in a new class called simul::clouds::Environment. By separating data-generation from the render classes, we allow more efficient re-use of data.
GL fog fixes.
Moved Bits structure to CloudInterface.h from CloudKeyframer.
Removed 16Bit option for cloud textures, it's to low-end for current targets. The cloud object is now part of the CloudKeyframer.
No more BaseSkyRenderer::Update() needed.CloudRenderCallback is gone - use iterator semantics instead now.
BaseGpuCloudGenerator is now a separate base class for separate GPU cloud generator classes like GpuCloudGenerator.Version 2.2.0.1005

Version 2.2.0
DX9 and OpenGL rendering is now in separate libraries (source provided).
The DirectX 9 render classes now return bool instead of HRESULT, to increase inter-API compatibility.
tonemap option removed from SimulWeatherRenderer - too complex.Usage of fade textures in the render implementations has changed. Before we took four textures (two losses, two inscatters) as 3D, with altitude as the Z-coordinate, and interpolated in the cloud or atmospherics shader.

Instead we pre-render them each frame to two 2D textures, eliminating both the altitude and time interpolation in this step.

RestoreDeviceObjects in DX9 now takes a void* - this is for inter-API compatibility.

DirectX renderers now have no Destroy() function, as InvalidateDeviceObjects provides this functionality.

Now BaseCloudRenderer uses MaxCloudDistanceKm to determine the distance to render clouds to, instead of using the hard-coded range from 180 to 320 km based on Detail.

SkyNode and ColourSkyNode classes abolished - BaseSky is now a direct descendant of Node.

In SkyKeyframer, TableHeight and TableWidth are now called NumElevations and NumDistances for clarity.

Removed precalculated gamma from cloud helpers - does anybody want this?

No longer setting license key from the cloud render classes. Now license_key is an initialization parameter to the weather renderers.Version 2.1.5

Introduced GPU-based cloud lighting - this is a renderer-based, platform-dependent feature which radically speeds-up calculation.Fixes for DirectX 10, DX11, and Visual Studio 10.Version 2.1.4

Shader fixes for Radeon cards.Version 2.1.3

Version 2.1.3

Multiple humidity callbacks are now supported - use AddHumidityCallback instead of SetHumidityCallback.
SetFadeTableInterface is no longer needed - SkyKeyframers transparently use BaseSkyInterface.Version 2.1.2

In BaseSkyInterface, CloudInterface, and derived classes, SetDaytime and GetDaytime have been replaced by the more general SetTime and GetTime, in order to allow for non time-of-day related keyframe timings.


CellularCloudNode::SetCacheNoise is no longer needed, and has been removed.Version 2.1.1

Visual Studio 2010 (VC10) now supported.
DirectX 10 and 11 supported in a set of double-purpose DX1x render classes.Version 2.1.0

Version 2.0.2

BaseCloudRenderer::CreateNoiseTexture has been created as pure virtual. All cloud renderers must now implement this function.Version 2.0.1

Optional caching for cloud keyframes (large memory usage).Version 2.0.0

Simul Weather Version 2.0: The second major iteration of Simul Weather.SkySequencer: celestial paths for sun and moon are displayed.
BasePrecipitationRenderer implemented, featuring rain and snow defaults. DirectX 11 Support.GetOvercastCallback moved to BaseCloudRenderer.Version 1.9.9

Fixed Sky Sequencer bug that reset colour sky keyframes when loaded after a non-colour sky.
FadeTableCallback is now SkyTexturesCallback.
Fixes for reflected clouds, e.g. mirrors, water etc.
Improved documentation.Version 1.9.8

SkyKeyframer now saves all three grid sizes - for number of distances, number of elevations, number of altitudes.Version 1.9.7

AltitudeFadeTable has been renamed to SkyKeyframer, to reflect its role better. ColourFadeTable is now ColourSkyKeyframer. BasePrecipitationRenderer is now the base class for rain and snow. Cloud keyframes have a RainToSnow value - zero is rain, one is snow.Version 1.9.6

OSG demo camera control fixed to get around OpenSceneGraph's camera update-lag bug.
ColourFadeTable has GetAmbientColour fixed and GetLocalIrradiance.Version 1.9.5

Version 1.9.4

Changes to CloudRenderCallback and FadeTableCallback. Instead of each having a single callback function to fill textures, we now have two. For clouds, FillCloudTextureSequentially, and FillCloudTextureBlock can be implemented. For skies, FillFadeTexturesSequentially and FillFadeTextureBlocks. Only one of each needs to be implemented! Whichever works better for your graphics API, implement that one
and call CloudKeyframer:: or AltitudeFadeTable::FillTexturesAsBlocks to set which one is used.Version 1.9.3

Version 1.9.2

AltitudeFadeTable interpolation fixes.Version 1.9.1

Version 1.9.0

Improved back and forward compatibility of .seq files.

DX9 and OpenGL samples try to load "default.seq" on startup. If successful, the demo plays back the saved sequence. Certain controls are disabled (these values are taken from the sequence file instead).

Sky sequences have a brightness value - this allows for brightening of night scenes.

Fixed some light-volume problems with non-wrapping cloud volumes.

Added date functions to SiderealSkyInterface; added date controls to Sky Sequencer.Version 1.8.4

Sky renderers are now derived from simul::sky::BaseSkyRenderer; Cloud renderers are now derived from simul::clouds::BaseCloudRenderer - this takes out some of the common factors in rendering so that OpenGL, DirectX etc can share more code. The .cpp files are included in the Simul/Sky and Simul/Clouds directory of the binary install.

In clouds, FractalEffectScale is now FractalAmplitude. FractalPatternScale is now FractalWavelength.Version 1.8.3

Added Camera headers and libs - useful for demos.New build systemThe following functions were moved up from SkyInterface to BaseSkyInterface: GetIsotropicColourLossFactor, GetIsotropicInscatterFactor, GetInscatterAngularMultiplierThe following functions were moved up from SkyInterface to BaseSkyInterface: GetIsotropicColourLossFactor, GetIsotropicInscatterFactor, GetInscatterAngularMultiplier
Introduced FadeMode to SimulCloudRenderer.Version 1.8.2

x64 version built.
OvercastEffect in CloudKeyframer determines strength of light blocking from clouds as it affects skies and fades.
BaseKeyframer is now the base class for both AltitudeFadeTable and CloudKeyframer. Moving towards defined keyframes rather than simple time-steps.Version 1.8.1

Fixed OpenGL sample shader faults.

Fixed AltitudeFadeTable uninitialized variable which_texture.OpenGL sample now uses GLSL shaders for sky and clouds.
InterpolatedFadeTable is not used anymore - AltitudeFadeTable has all its functionality, just use a single altitude step.
In simul::sky::Sky, AutomaticRayleighCoefficients has been removed - this no longer overrides manual settings of Rayleigh coefficients.
Instead, use the function CalcAutomaticRayleighCoefficients(), if and when needed, this uses the ColourWavelengthsNm values.Version 1.8.0

Only BaseSkyInterface is required by CloudKeyframer, not full SkyInterface - much easier to use custom non-Simul skies.

Help beefed-up.

Renamed DX9 Atmospherics Sample to DX9 Sample.
Separated CloudGeometryHelper into 2D and 3D versions.Time-based changes in cloud noise are now based on Daytime, rather than number of iterations - this allow repeatability for specific times of day. See SetNoisePeriod.
NoisePeriod - now a float in daytime units.Version 1.7.1

Sky checksum separated into GetAtmosphericPropertiesChecksum() and GetAtmosphericStateChecksum() - state changes over time, property changes should force a rebuild of sky colours.Version 1.7.0

Visual Studio 2008 is now the lead development environment. The Simul libraries will be developed in 2008 and downgraded automatically for use with 2005.
Cg is no longer included in the SDK install - use the up-to-date Cg Toolkit from nVidia.Version 1.6.4

Use "Cloudiness" in CloudKeyframer, this overrides the humidity setting in cloud nodes.

SimulGLSkyRenderer now uses FadeTableCallback, much more efficient than self-updating its textures.Version 1.6.3

Fixes and improvements to the fadetables. New classes: ColourSky, and ColourFadeTable -these allow skies to be keyframed with colour values instead of physical calculation.Added command SetNoFrustumLimit(bool) to CloudGeometryHelper, so geometry has no frustum limits. Added UpdateLayerGeometry as an alternative to MakeLayerGeometry, performance faster for SetNoFrustumLimit(true).Version 1.6.2

The cloud keyframer has been taken out of CellularCloudNode, and should now be created in its own right. This makes it possible to have custom keyframers.
simul::sky::SkyInterface::GetDirectionToLight() has been introduced - it normally returns the results of GetDirectionToSun, but the default simul::sky::Sky, for example, can return the moon direction if it is brighter than sunlight.Version 1.6.1

In simul::sky::TextureGenerator, Make1DSuperfastSky has been renamed to Make1DSkyTexture. Because everything is superfast.

The Xbox 360 version now uses XDK 11164 (February 2010).

Radical improvements to startup speed.

Version 1.4

Samples have improved support for older ATI cards.

Help contains feedback forms.

Version 1.3

The Xbox 360 version is built with XDK 9328.

The Realtime property of simul::clouds::CellularCloudGrid is no longer used. All clouds are realtime.

Version 1.2

Fade tables: The FadeTable class in simul::sky manages tables of distance-fade values, which update as time passes. You can use these to get fast, accurate distance fading that reflects the lighting  and haze in the environment. See, for example, &lt;a onclick="parser('../Samples/DirectX Sample/SimulSkyRenderer.cpp')" style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; cursor: hand"&gt;SimulSkyRenderer.cpp&lt;/a&gt; in the DirectX sample for usage.

Cloud evolution: much improved, and also faster.

Threading: multi-threading with Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB). You can turn this on or off for individual clouds. When activated, calculation and lighting is distributed on the available cores.

Version 1.1.1

New naming convention: depending on which runtime was used to compile, these suffixes are added to each lib and dll:

_MD
_MDd
_MT
_MTd

All the runtimes are multithreaded. MD means it was built for the DLL runtime - i.e. runtime functions are in a
separate DLL. MDd is the debug version. MT means it was built with the static runtime - runtime functions are included, making the filesize bigger.
MTd is the debug version of this.

You should use whatever runtime your main program uses - it's in &lt;em&gt;Project Properties/C++/Code Generation/Runtime Library&lt;/em&gt;. 

Standard practice is to use the runtime DLL's unless you have a good reason not to.

Version 1.0.19

The main cloud class is now simul::clouds::FastCloudNode, instead of simul::clouds::CellularCloudNode.

SetFractalRepeatLength and SetFractalOffsetScale, which were in metres, have been replaced with dimensionless
numbers SetFractalEffectScale and SetFractalPatternScale.

There is no need to use a separate update call for building and lighting the clouds. Instead, use UpdatePartial(float proportion).

SetNoiseScale is no longer needed. The noise scale is always the largest grid dimension of the cloud volume.Version 2.1.7

Version 2.1.6

Version 2.1.5

Version 2.1.5

Version 2.1.5

Version 2.1.5

Introduced GPU-based cloud lighting - this is a renderer-based, platform-dependent feature which radically speeds-up calculation.Fixes for DirectX 10, DX11, and Visual Studio 10.Version 2.1.4
