<div class="textblock"><p>This class controls ocean waves.</p>
<p>We can drive the sea properties by means of the correspondence between wind speed, wave height and Beaufort number.</p>
<h2>Beaufort number | Description |Wind speed |Wave height |Sea conditions |Land conditions </h2>
<p>0 | Calm |&lt; 0.3-m/s | 0-m |Flat |Calm. Smoke rises vertically. 1 | Light air |0.3-1.5-m/s | 0-0.2 m |Ripples without crests. |Smoke drift indicates wind direction. Leaves and wind vanes are stationary. 2 | Light breeze |1.6-3.3-m/s | 0.2-0.5 m |Small wavelets. Crests of glassy appearance, not breakings |Wind felt on exposed skin. Leaves rustle. Wind vanes begin to move. 3 | Gentle breeze |3.4-5.4-m/s | 0.5-1 m |Large wavelets. Crests begin to break; scatteredwhitecaps |Leaves and small twigs constantly moving, light flags extended. 4 | Moderate breeze |5.5-7.9-m/s | 1-2 m |Small waves with breaking crests. Fairly frequent whitecaps. |Dust and loose paper raised. Small branches begin to move. 5 | Fresh breeze |8.0-10.7-m/s | 2-3 m |Moderate waves of some length. Many whitecaps. Small amounts of spray. |Branches of a moderate size move. Small trees in leaf begin to sway. 6 | Strong breeze |10.8-13.8-m/s | 3-4 m |Long waves begin to form. White foam crests very frequent. Some airborne spray . |Large branches in motion. Whistling heard in overhead wires. Umbrella use becomes difficult. Empty plastic bins tip over. 7 | High wind - near-gale| 13.9-17.1-m/s | 4-5.5 m |Sea heaps up. Some foam from breaking waves is blown into streaks along wind direction. Moderate amounts of airborne spray. |Whole trees in motion. Effort needed to walk against the wind. 8 | Gale, fresh gale | 17.2-20.7-m/s | 5.5-7.5 m |Moderately high waves with breaking crests forming spindrift. Well-marked streaks of foam blown along wind direction. Considerable airborne spray. |Some twigs broken from trees. Cars veer on road. Progress on foot is seriously impeded. 9 | Strong gale | 20.8-24.4-m/s | 7-10 m |High waves whose crests sometimes roll over. Dense foam is blown along wind direction. Large amounts of airborne spray may begin to reduce visibility. |Some branches break off trees, and some small trees blow over. Construction/temporary signs and barricades blow over. 10 | Storm,whole gale | 24.5-28.4-m/s | 9-12.5 m |Very high waves with overhanging crests. Large patches of foam from wave crests give the sea a white appearance. Considerable tumbling of waves with heavy impact. Large amounts of airborne spray reduce visibility.| Trees are broken off or uprooted, structural damage likely. 11 | Violent storm | 28.5-32.6-m/s | 11.5-16 m |Exceptionally high waves. Very large patches of foam, driven before the wind, cover much of the sea surface. Very large amounts of airborne spray severely reduce visibility. |Widespread vegetation and structural damage likely. 12 | Hurricaneforce? | &gt;=32.7-m/s | 14 m |Huge waves. Sea is completely white with foam and spray. Air is filled with driving spray, greatly reducing visibility. |Severe widespread damage to vegetation and structures. Debris and unsecured objects are hurled about. </p>
