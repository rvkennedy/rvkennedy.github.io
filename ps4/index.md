trueSKY is a complete atmospheric environment rendering middleware.

Main Features
-------------
**Time of Day**
trueSKY calculates the colours of the sky at any time of day in real time on the GPU. The sky is blended seamlessly with the trueSKY atmospherics, transforming the appearance of any outdoor scene. The atmospheric colours vary with time of day and year, temperature, atmospheric composition and altitude.

**Volumetric Clouds**
Simul's award-winning volumetric cloud system renders dynamic clouds in real time. Cloud formations can be edited, and cued to change over time, either in a predetermined way, or dynamically, based on game parameters. trueSKY clouds blend with the surrounding landscape and atmosphere, maintaining their visual quality when viewed from any angle - above, below, even inside the clouds.

**Sun, moon and stars**
Positions of the sun, moon and stars are calculated and updated in real time, based on accurate ephemeris models. They can also be positioned and keyframed manually for complete control of the scene.

**Sky Sequencer**
The Sky Sequencer enabled editing of all trueSKY's weather effects in a keyframed sequence. Each control corresponds to an API call for dynamic modification of the atmospheric state.

**SDK and Engine Support**
The trueSKY SDK makes it simple to incorporate into arbitrary renderers. There are ready-made engine plugins for Unreal Engine 4 and Unity 5, providing full native API access and the Sequencer toolset, built-into the engine editors.
